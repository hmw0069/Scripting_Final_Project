# Scripting_Final_Project
This file includes details about the design for my final project.


## Purpose of Project
This project aims to gather and understand information about color patterning in both the larval and adult stage of butterflies. Specifically, I will be analyzing the variance of larval/adult coloration present in species of the Papilionidae family found in North America. Papilionidae includes less species than other families, so I figured this would be a good place to start. Coloration can range from cryptic to conspicuous in both of these life stages of  butterflies, and so I'd like to see if caterpillars that are cryptic remain cryptic as adults (same for conspiuous larvae/adults), or if there is a shift in coloration strategies as caterpillars pupate into adults. This project is largely inspired by[this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7006464/); I am posing the same question as these authors, but plan on using a different set of species, as their study was focused on Australian butterfly species. However, I will probably only be focusing on characterizing caterpillar/adult colors.

## Coding Languages
I will likely be using R for most of the data analysis and scripting.

## Existing Packages
I will be using basic R packages, but ggplot will probably also be useful.

## Data Source
I will use a species list of Papilionidae gathered from the book "The butterflies of North America: a natural history and field guide" by James Scott. This will give me a list to start from, and then from here I can look on iNaturalist or butterfliesandmoths.org to obtain pictures of species. 
Data from Medina, et al. that contains useful R scripts and functions: https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.c866t1g3c
