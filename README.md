# Scripting_Final_Project
This file includes details about the design for my final project.


## Purpose of Project
This project aims to gather and understand information about color patterning in both the larval and adult stage of butterflies. Specifically, I will be analyzing the variance of larval/adult coloration present in species of the Papilionidae family found in North America. Papilionidae includes less species than other families, so I figured this would be a good place to start. Coloration can range from cryptic to conspicuous in both of these life stages of  butterflies, and so I'd like to see if caterpillars that are cryptic remain cryptic as adults (same for conspiuous larvae/adults), or if there is a shift in coloration strategies as caterpillars pupate into adults. This project is largely inspired by[this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7006464/); I am posing the same question as these authors, but plan on using a different set of species, as their study was focused on Australian butterfly species. HOWEVER, if this becomes too big of an undertaking, then I will collect additional data on the hostplant of the species that they used, and lo

## Coding Languages
I will likely be using R for most of the data analysis and scripting.
